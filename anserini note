When installing anserini, be sure to follow their instructions. 
Specifically, they have a "tools" subdirectory which is actually another repo which has been merged. 
They suggest a specific command to ensure that subdirectories are included when installing anserini
from that repo. While it may be tempting to try other commands, do exactly what they say from
the command line. Otherwise, anserini may not work !
